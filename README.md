## Project setup


### Setting up a virtual environment
At the root of the project, create a virtual environment using the command:
```shell
python -m venv venv
```
Activate it:
```shell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then we install all the dependencies from the `req.txt` file into the virtual environment:

```shell
pip install -r req.txt
```

### Migrations
**Postgres must be enabled for migration**

If all the previous steps are completed successfully, all that remains for you is to apply the migrations, for this we use this command:

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

### Launch of the project
After successful configuration, you need to write the following command to run the django app:
Write the data from the file to your database
```shell
python.exe -Xutf8 manage.py loaddata agents/fixture/agents.json
python.exe -Xutf8 manage.py loaddata houses/fixture/houses.json
```
Create superuser
```shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Launch of the project
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
